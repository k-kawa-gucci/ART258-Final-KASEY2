  <p>
    As soon as you get on the SCROOSER and start pushing off the ground, you activate the impulse drive system. Your muscle power is immediately complemented by the electric motor, enabling you to accelerate to speeds of up to 25 km/h. What makes the motor so special is that it analyses the force of your movements and adjusts the acceleration in line with your riding style – therefore it’s not just the heart of the SCROOSER, but the mind too.

  <p>
    The power pack lives up to its name – because it really does carry a lot of power: the 36 V battery has storage capacity of 20 Ah. The battery is stowed out of sight beneath the footboard. When, after about 55 km, it is due to be recharged, simply unlock the footboard and take the battery straight out. After just two hours of charging, 80% of its capacity will have been replenished. In other words, it just needs a little breather.

  <p>
  A display is located in the middle of the handlebars. That is your cockpit. This panel lets you keep everything in view – and in hand. This is where you turn the SCROOSER on and off. You can also select the driving mode here – E for ECO, C for COMFORT or S for SPORT. And finally, it tells you immediately how fast you are travelling or how much juice is left in the battery. So keep an eye on the traffic – and another on the swanky display of your SCROOSER.

  <p>
  Even though you don’t need a helmet* to ride your SCROOSER, you can rest assured that we take the issue of safety very seriously. Here are just a couple of examples: hydraulic disc brakes provide optimised and reliable braking, whereas the forks and handlebars are made of steel to enable them to withstand even the toughest conditions. After all, it’s not only about looking good on your SCROOSER but also about arriving safely.

  <p>
  Made in Germany with passion and attention to detail. Even though it already boasts high-quality materials and outstanding craftsmanship, we have no intention of stopping there. We develop regular software updates, for instance, in order to continuously enhance the drive system. As you can see, we have the same unrelenting drive as the SCROOSER.

  We want you and your SCROOSER to be inseparable. You can be sure of that. To this end, the SCROOSER provides three security systems, all independent of one another. You activate your SCROOSER with the digital key – your TAG. Without it, the SCROOSER is not going anywhere. The second security system is the immobiliser. And then there is also the anti-theft lock under the seat.

  The SCROOSER is a real eye-catcher that turns the city into your stage. And to make sure that stage is always well-lit, the SCROOSER has a powerful LED on its front. And of course, there is also a red light at the rear. Because passers-by will be watching your SCROOSER zoom away from them. That’s just something you’ll have to get used to.
